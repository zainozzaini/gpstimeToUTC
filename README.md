GPS, Global Positioning System time, is the atomic time scale implemented by the atomic clocks in the GPS ground control stations and the GPS satellites themselves. GPS time was zero at 0h 6-Jan-1980 and since it is not perturbed by leap seconds GPS is now ahead of UTC by 16 seconds.

GPS Week Number
The GPS Week Number count began at midnight on the evening of 05 January 1980 / morning of 06 January 1980. Since that time, the count has been incremented by 1 each week, and broadcast as part of the GPS message. The GPS Week Number field in the data stream is modulo 1024. This meant that at the completion of week 1023, the GPS Week Number rolled over to 0 on midnight GPS Time of the evening of 21 August 1999 / morning of 22 August 1999.

GPS TIME
The GPS time (seconds into the week) always starts on Sunday morning at 00:00 GMT. Each 24 hour period contains 86,400 seconds. A full week contains 604,800 seconds. Please see the table below for a breakdown of hourly / daily increments.

Therefore I just assume that Sun Jan 06 1980 00:00:00 is 315936000000 at GMT+0800 (MYT).
